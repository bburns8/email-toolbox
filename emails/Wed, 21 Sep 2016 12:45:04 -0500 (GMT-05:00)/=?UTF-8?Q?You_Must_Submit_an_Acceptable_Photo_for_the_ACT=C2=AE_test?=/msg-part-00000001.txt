If you are still planning to test, log in to your ACT Web account at www.actstudent.org and add your photo TODAY.  You may use your computer or mobile device.  On test day you must have a printed copy of your ticket that includes your photo.  For complete information about adding a photo, go to www.actstudent.org/regist/add-photo.html.
