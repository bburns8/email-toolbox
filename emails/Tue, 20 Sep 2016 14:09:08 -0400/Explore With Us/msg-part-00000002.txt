<br>
Let’s talk more about academics. As we’ve said, UM has an abundance of majors, minors and programs to choose from. That’s a lot of options, and to help you explore them, we grouped them into five areas of study, which you will see below. Check them out, ask us questions and challenge yourself to explore new opportunities.<br>
