Dear Blake:

 Your parent has confirmed that they wish to receive copies of emails we send you, effective immediately.

 For your security, your parent will not be able to take any action requested in any email copies they receive.  The emails will be for their information only.

 If you wish to change the email address for your parent, or if at some point your parent no longer wants to  receive copies of emails sent to you, simply log in to your account and delete or change the parent name and  email address shown on the "Your Information" screen (access via "Manage Your Profile" link on left side of main screen).

Thank you.
